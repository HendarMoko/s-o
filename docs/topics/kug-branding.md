[//]: # (title: KUG branding)

A Kotlin User Group, or KUG, is a community that is  dedicated to Kotlin and that offers you a place to share your
Kotlin programming experience with like-minded people.

## Kotlin User Group

To become an KUG, your community should have some specific features shared by every KUG. It should:
* Provide Kotlin-related content, with regular meetups as the main form of activity.
* Host regular events (at least once every 3 months) with open registration and without any restriction for attendance.
* Be driven and organized by the community, and it should not use events to earn money or gain any other business
  benefits from members and attendees.
* Follow and ensure a code of conduct in order to provide a welcoming environment for attendees of any background and
  experience (check-out our recommended [Code of Conduct](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+Open+Source+and+Community+Code+of+Conduct)).

There are no limits regarding the format for KUG meetups. They can take place in whatever fashion works best for the
community, whether that includes presentations, hands-on labs, lectures, hackathons, or informal beer-driven get-togethers.

### How to run a KUG?

* In order to promote group cohesion and prevent miscommunication, we recommend keeping to a limit of one KUG per city. Check out [the list of KUGs](https://kotlinlang.org/community/user-groups) to see if there is already a KUG in your area.
* Use the official KUG logo and branding. Check out [the branding guidelines](#kotlin-user-group-brand-assets).
* Keep your user group active. Run meetups regularly, at least once every 3 months.
* Announce your KUG meetups at least 2 weeks in advance. The announcement should contain a list of talks
  and the names of the speakers, as well as the location, timing, and any other crucial info about the event.
* KUG events should be free or, if you need to cover organizing expenses, limit prices to a maximum of 10 USD.
* Your group should have a code of conduct available for all members.

If your community has all the necessary features and follows these guidelines, you are ready to [Apply to be a new

### Support for KUGs from JetBrains

Active KUGs that host at least 1 meetup every 3 months can apply for the community support program, which includes:
* Official KUG branding.
* A special entry on the Kotlin website.
* Free licenses for JetBrains products to raffle off at meetups.
* Priority support for Kotlin events and campaigns.
* Help recruiting speakers for events.

### Support from JetBrains for other tech communities

If you organize any other tech communities, you can apply for support as well. By doing so, you may receive: free JetBrains product licenses to raffle off at meetups, information about Kotlin official events and campaigns, Kotlin stickers, and help with recruiting Kotlin speakers for your events.

## Kotlin User Group brand assets

We provide Kotlin user groups with a logo that is specifically designed to be recognizable and convey a reference to Kotlin.

* The official Kotlin logo is associated with the language itself. It should not be used otherwise in different scopes, as this could cause confusion. The same applies to its close derivatives.
* User groups logo also means that the opinions and actions of the community are independent of the Kotlin team.
* Your opinions don't have to agree with ours, and we think this is the most beneficial model for a creative and strong community.

### Style for user groups

Since the launch of the Kotlin community support program at the beginning of 2017, the number of user groups has multiplied, with around 2-4 new user groups joining us every month. Please check out the complete list of groups in the ‘Kotlin User Groups’ section to find one in your area.

We provide new Kotlin user groups with a user group logo and a profile picture.

There are two main reasons why we are doing it:

* Firstly, we received numerous requests from the community asking for special Kotlin style branded materials to help them be recognized as officially dedicated user groups.
* Secondly, we wanted to provide a distinct style for the user group and community content to make it clear which Kotlin-related materials are from the official team and which are created by the community.

### Create the logo of your user group

To create a logo of your users group:
1. Copy the Kotlin user group [logo file](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1CQ5CrEuQhYubcPkAjTBcy6lnY7mcrgd8pUr2NAh0qE8/edit) to your Google drive (you have to be signed in to your Google account).
2. Replace the ‘Groupname’ text with the name of your user group.
3. Download the picture and use it for the user group materials.
