[//]: # (title: Basic types)

In Kotlin, everything is an object in the sense that we can call member functions and properties on any variable.
Some types can have a special internal representation - for example, numbers, characters and booleans can be
represented as primitive values at runtime - but to the user they look like ordinary classes. 
In this section we describe the basic types used in Kotlin: [numbers](numbers.md) and their [unsigned counterparts](unsigned-integer-types.md), 
[booleans](booleans.md), [characters](characters.md), [strings](strings.md), and [arrays](arrays.md).
